# Screeps

### Description

This repo is linked to my account named "Whimsiccal" on [screeps.com](https://screeps.com).  

Please excuse the poor file structure, screeps does not natively support directories for file
management.

Screeps is an MMO sandbox game for programmers where each player manages their own screeps colony 
through JavaScript code a single persistent world shared by all the players.  

If you are familiar with gaming it is like an RTS game but due to your code running even while
you aren't actively watching your screeps they can react to events without your presence.  

### Installation

Screeps can be played from your web browser and through the account management settings you can 
directly link a github repository (like I have done here) which the website will download anytime 
a push is made to the repo.  

Feel free to use my code on your screeps game for fun or to submit a pull request if you have an imrpovement.
