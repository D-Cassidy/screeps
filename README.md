# Screeps

### Description

This repo is linked to my account named "Whimsiccal" on [screeps.com](https://screeps.com).  

Please excuse the poor file structure, screeps does not natively support directories for file
management AFAIK.

Screeps is an MMO sandbox game for programmers where each player manages their own screeps colony 
through JavaScript code a single persistent world shared by all the players.  

If you are familiar with gaming it's like an RTS game but due to the server persisting even
while you don't have the client open they can react to events in the game world based on what your 
code instructs them to do.

### Installation

Screeps can be played from your web browser and through the account management settings you can 
directly link a github repository (like I have done here) which the website will download anytime 
a push is made to the repo.  

If you would like to test my code in game for yourself, you can download the official client on steam, open the 
local folder containing your scripts with a terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/D-Cassidy/screeps 
```

Feel free to use my code on your screeps game for fun or submit a pull request if you have an improvement.
